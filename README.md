Implementation Plan
Step 1: Get the Dataset
Use a public dataset like "Telco Customer Churn" from Kaggle.
Or any dataset containing customer details and churn status.
Step 2: Load & Explore Data
Use pandas to load the dataset.
Check missing values, data types, and basic statistics.
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding).
Normalize numerical columns.
Step 4: Model Building
Use Logistic Regression as the baseline model.
Try Random Forest, Decision Trees, or SVM for better performance.
Step 5: Model Evaluation
Check Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Step 6: Save & Upload the Model
Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.
Upload the code & README.md to GitHub.
Share the GitHub/LinkedIn URL.
